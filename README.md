# Analysis of School District Data
## 1) Project Overview
### Purpose of the analysis
To help Maria, who is a chief data scientist for City school District, update the school district analysis that was found to contain altered grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, and providing the school district board with the updated school performance trends which can assist them in the budget allotments decision. 

The math and reading testing scores of 9th graders at Thomas High school will be replaced with NaNs, representing them as a missing data, while the rest of the data will be kept intact. The analysis will then be performed on this clean dataset to see how the school performances as well as the overall analysis are affected.

### Resources
